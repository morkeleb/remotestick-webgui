This is a simple webgui for the remotestick-server project located at https://github.com/pakerfeldt/remotestick

Simply copy the content into the same directory as the remotestick server.

The gui will then be available at:
http://localhost:8422/s/

That is given that you do not configure remotestick-server to run on a different port.

v0.2
Made better support for mobile browsers
added buttons to turn on or off all devices
added a add device button
fixed an issue where the dimmer wouldnt dim

v0.1
The UI lists all configured devices and allows you to turn them on or off using the webbrowser.
