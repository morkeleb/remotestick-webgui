This is a simple webgui for the remotestick-server project located at https://github.com/pakerfeldt/remotestick

Simply copy the content into the same directory as the remotestick server.

The gui will then be available at:
http://localhost:8422/s/

in version 0.4 of the remotestick-server you need to specify "-f static" in the start up commandline arguments for the s/ directory to work. 

That is given that you do not configure remotestick-server to run on a different port.

added a add device button
fixed an issue where the dimmer wouldnt dim

v0.1
